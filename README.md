MUSA 509 Final Project - Unifying transit in Philadelphia

This is a data dashboard built with Python, Google BigQuery, Airflow, and JavaScript that looks at the intersection of SEPTA stops and Indego stops. It is intended to provoke questions about the utility of creating some sort of unified transit solution that allows riders to make use of SEPTA and Indego together.
