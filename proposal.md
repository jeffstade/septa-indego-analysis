## Abstract

Thereâ€™s an increasing interest in moving toward unifying fare payments across transit services and private mobility operators. For example, San Francisco recently made a $300 million dollar investment into improving [Clipper Card][1] service which can be used on any of 24 different services in the Bay Area. Chicago is piloting a program with Uber where riders can pay for an Uber ride and transit ticket with a single payment. Pittsburgh recently launched [Move PGH][2], a first-of-its-kind initiative to promote many different mobility services to residents through the Transit App and digital signage.

What might it look like to unify fare payment in Philadelphia? This dashboard can help stakeholders in Philadelphia assess and visualize the viability and utility of unifying fare payments within the city.  

The dashboard will visualize rides across a variety of services that are available to riders in central Philadelphia. In particular:
- SEPTA subway and buses
- PATCO trains
- Indego bike share

These services are not inclusive of all options that are currently available for riders (eg. rideshare, commuter rail, taxis), but this dashboard is an initial analysis. Particular attention will be paid to multi-modal trips (eg. Incorporating two or more services in a ride) and how a unified fare system may increase overall mobility for riders, providing them with access to more destinations and opportunities.  

These metrics will allow stakeholders to explore some of the following questions:
- low rates of local business ownership may prompt business education programs for community residents
- increasing average time since
- low foot traffic in the face of other positively trending metrics may prompt public space activation events

## Stakeholders

* Transit officials who want to identify commercial districts where additional resources might be helpful.
* Private mobility operators that want to work with and support public transit.
* Riders and residents that advocate for improved mobility options.

## Data sources

* SEPTA rail stops
* PATCO rail stops ([https://transitfeeds.com/p/patco/533][3])

* Philadelphia neighborhoods ([https://github.com/azavea/geo-data][5])
* **US Census Block Group demographics** -- BigQuery public datasets, updated with the national census, i.e. yearly estimates at its most frequent
